- Users must be given one of the following roles:
    1. User
        - A user with this role can update content on the site, but not manage other users.
    1. Admin
        - A user with this role has full permissions to manage the content on the site as well as manage other users.
- When logged in as a user with the Admin role, navigate to "Configuration" to change and apply settings.
